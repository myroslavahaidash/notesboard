# Notesboard

This project was created for practice with the new Angular 2. The projectâ€™s idea was stolen from the well-known site trello.com. The application allows you to create lists of notes and group them into boards. You can move notes between lists, and lists - between boards. Also each note may include several checklists with a progress bar.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.
